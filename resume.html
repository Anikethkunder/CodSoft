    <h3>Currency Converter:</h3>
    <li>
        A currency conversion app is a software application that allows users to convert one currency to another. Currency conversion apps are often used by people who travel internationally, but they can also be used by people who shop online or who do business with people from other countries.
        
        Currency conversion apps typically work by using real-time exchange rates to convert currencies. The user simply enters the amount of money they want to convert and the currency they want to convert it to, and the app will display the equivalent amount in the other currency.</li>

<h3>
    Portfolio
</h3>
    
<li>A portfolio is a collection of work that showcases your skills and experience. It is used to demonstrate your abilities to potential employers, clients, or investors.
    
    A portfolio can be physical or digital. A physical portfolio typically includes printed copies of your work, such as resumes, cover letters, and work samples. A digital portfolio can be a website, blog, or online gallery that showcases your work.
    
    When creating a portfolio, it is important to choose your work carefully. Select your best work that is relevant to the type of job or client you are targeting. You should also make sure that your portfolio is well-organized and easy to navigate.</li>
